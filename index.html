            <p align = "left"> <b> <font size = "9"> <span class="wave">👋🏾</span> </font> </b> <br> <br> I'm a second-year Computer Science major student at Occidental College. This year, I'm taking Data Structures and Human Computer Interaction, working diligently to learn about the significant intersection of humanities and tech such as in the field of UX/UI. <br>I aspire to design more meaningful, ethically aware, and aesthetic technology.<br> <br> Through Occidental College's <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/academics/areas-study/computer-science">Computer Science Program 👩‍💻,</a> <br> I am combining my major of Computer Science with Cognitive Science + Media Arts And Culture. <br> <br> I absorb my surroundings visually. Apart from my strong affinity for the tech world, I love making videos, exploring cinematography and telling stories 🎞️. I love to rave over the color yellow and sing as well!<br> <br> I'm still modifying this site! Watch it for future projects! </p>
