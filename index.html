            <p align = "left"> <b> <font size = "6"><span class="wave">👋 About Me </span> </font> </b> <br> <br> I'm a <b>Computer Science major student at Occidental College. </b> 
                Through the careful selection of my coursework, I am working diligently to learn about the significant intersection of 
                humanities and tech such as in the field of UX/UI. <br> <br>I aspire
                 to design more meaningful, ethically aware, and aesthetic 
                 technology. </br> <br> <br> Through Occidental College's
                  <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/academics/areas-study/computer-science">Computer Science Program 👩‍💻,</a> 
                  <br> I am combining my major of Computer Science with courses in Human Behavior such as Sociology, Psychology, and hopefully even Economics! 
                  <b>I thrive in spaces that encourage interdisciplinary thinking.</b> <br> 
                  <br> I absorb my surroundings visually. Apart from my strong affinity for the tech world,
                   I love making videos, exploring cinematography and telling stories 🎞️. I love to rave
                    over the color yellow and sing as well!<br> <br> I am deeply curious about the human condition,
                    and how we can create human-centered systems that enforce community. I'd love to chat with you! </p>
